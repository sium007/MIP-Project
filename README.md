# MIP-Project

script.py file contains the codes for creating .csv files (plos1sequence.csv and newextra.csv) from .fasta files (plos1sequence.fasta and newextra.fasta). Here 7 aa sequence for 7 specific positions were taken as features. 

new_classifier.py file contains the code for checking the performance of different classifiers upon the train data (plos1sequence.csv) and test data (newextra.csv)

identifier.py file contains the code where it takes an input (an aa sequnce) as fasta format in unknown.fasta and as the output it predicts which type of MIP it is.
